LuckyNode Converter
This is a snippet I built to convert the number of nodes an user earn in a game application.
User earns 3 coloured nodes (green, blue and gold) from spinning a wheel of fortune. This JS class will convert all the earned nodes according to rules set in config file

For example:
var user_nodes = [{node: “green”}, {node: “green”}, {node: “green”}, {node: “green”}, {node: “green”},
{node: “green”}, {node: “green”}, {node: “blue”}, {node: “blue”}, {node: “blue”},
{node: “blue”}, {node: “blue”}, {node: “blue”}, {node: “blue”}, {node: “blue”}, {node: “blue”}, {node: “blue”}, {node: “gold”}];

APP_CONFIG.NODE_RULES =  [ //start from the lowest level
      { convertFrom : NODE_LV_1 , convertTo : NODE_LV_2, unit : 2 },
    	{ convertFrom : NODE_LV_2 , convertTo : NODE_LV_3, unit : 3 }
];

APP_CONFIG.NODE_LEVELS = {
			green 	: 0,
			blue 	: 1
};

var converter = new NodeConverter();
var converted_node = converter.convertNodes(user_nodes);
